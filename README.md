Februrary 11 2021: Ah hah hah! My grammar! Terrible! Well, it's been a long way. I've started using Github for almost 1 year now, time really does fly huh? It kinda reminds you of how short our lives are. And if we don't use it to the max, we'll never get it back. Anyway, thank you for reading this. In fact, this is my very first repository! Ever since then I've been upgrading my skills and grow as a person. And I definitely need to work on my grammar! Sheesh, I can't believe how terrible I am at english! But, for old times sake, I don't want to change anything. I'll keep this repository as a rememberer that I've grown and become a much, much stroger person then before.
